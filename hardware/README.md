# hardware

This folder contains folders and files for all hardware provided by this project.


## Usage

If your project only consists of hardware (i.e. there is no software), you don't need to put your
`design` and `fabrication` folders into a `hardware` folder; instead, you should just move your
`design` and `fabrication` folders to the top level of your repository, and you should delete this
`hardware/README.md` file and instead just add content to the repository's top-level `README.md`
file.

The `design` folder should contain files in a format suitable for making changes to the design.
If you would like to provide fabrication files in a format suitable for uploading to a digital
fabrication machine, you can do so in the `fabrication` folder; though it is better and more
conventional to upload them as attachments on your repository's
[Github Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases).

You should include documentation in this `hardware/README.md` file about how to open, modify,
fabricate, assemble, and operate the hardware provided in this folder.
