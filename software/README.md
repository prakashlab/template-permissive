# software

This folder contains folders and files for all software provided by this project.


## Usage

If your project only consists of software (i.e. there is no hardware), you don't need to put your
files and folders into a `softwre` folder; instead, you should just move your
files and folders to the top level of your repository, and you should delete this
`software/README.md` file and instead just add content to the repository's top-level `README.md`
file.

You should include documentation in this `software/README.md` file about how to set up, develop,
build, configure, and operate the software provided in this folder.
